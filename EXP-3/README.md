# Experiment No. 3 – Implement Routing in Single Page Application (SPA)

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of **routing in a Single Page Application (SPA)** using React.  
Routing allows navigation between different pages/components without reloading the entire webpage.

---

## 🎯 Aim
To implement client-side routing in a Single Page Application so that different views are rendered dynamically using URLs.

---

## 🧠 Theory
A Single Page Application (SPA) loads only one HTML page and dynamically updates content as the user interacts with the application.  
Routing in SPA is handled on the client side, which avoids full page reloads and improves performance and user experience.

React uses **React Router** to manage navigation between components such as Home, About, and Contact pages.
